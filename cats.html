          It is important the queen (a female cat that is pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible.
          Monitor each kitten’s growth to ensure steady progress. If a kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate,
          a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly with a bottle or feeding tube.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include competition for milk, gastrointestinal
          disease, or environmental conditions such as extreme heat, cold, or unsanitary conditions.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
        <p>
          Kittens can typically start eating soft wet kitten food around three to four weeks after birth. They should
          eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has
          difficulty eating dry food, you can add a small amount of water to soften it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kitten-specific food provides the additional nutrients needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Always
          consult with your veterinarian for recommendations tailored to your cat’s breed and health.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">One Year to Seven Years</h2>
        <p>
          At this stage, cats are adults and do not need as many nutrients as kittens. Activity levels and metabolism
          slow down, so free-feeding throughout the day is not recommended. Instead, offer meals at set times to reduce
          the risk of obesity and other weight-related health concerns.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Seven Years and Older</h2>
        <p>
          As cats age, their bodies change and they may need fewer calories but higher-quality protein. When purchasing
          food, look for products that list specific proteins (such as “salmon”) rather than broad categories. Talk with
          your veterinarian about appropriate diets for senior cats.
