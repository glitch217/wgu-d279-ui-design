          The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices
          as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog
          offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a
          companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show
          medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies should
          be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to
          six months old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to
          one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. Just a 10 percent
          decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep
          your dog hydrated.

        <h2 class="section-title">Grooming &amp; Handling</h2>
        <p>
          Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. Brush frequently to reduce shedding
          and prevent matted and tangled fur. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting
          heavily wooded areas. Use soap formulated for dogs and rinse thoroughly to avoid skin irritation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful how you handle your dog. For small dogs, cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the
          forearm supporting the back half. For large dogs, reach under the belly with both arms, supporting the chest
          and rear as you lift.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Vaccinations &amp; Medications</h2>
        <p>
          You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines typically recommended
          to help protect against diseases such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Additional vaccines may be
          recommended depending on your dog’s environment and lifestyle.
